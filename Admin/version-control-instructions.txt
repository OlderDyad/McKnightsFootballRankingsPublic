Version Control Process for McKnight Football Rankings WebAssembly Project

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.

2. To commit the current development version to stable-release and create a new development version:

   ./Admin/version-control.sh <new_version_name>

Example:
   ./Admin/version-control.sh dev-2024-10

What this does:
- Merges the current development branch into stable-release.
- Pushes the stable release branch to the remote repository.
- Creates a new development branch based on the stable version.
- Pushes the new development branch to the remote repository.

Ensure that the script has execute permissions:

   chmod +x Admin/version-control.sh

Version management steps are now automated.
